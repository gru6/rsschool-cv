## **About me** 

I'm a lawyer. I'm interested in world politics, economics, and social processes. I think laws are similar to algorithms, but they are execute much worse. Also Iâ€™m fond of thinking about new technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, futuristic gadgets and then how they affect a person or society. Black mirror is a brilliant series, if you know what I mean.
